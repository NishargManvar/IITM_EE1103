IITM Sem_1 Course_EE1103

This repository contains all the codes and PDFs I wrote and made while attempting the assignments to the course EE1103.
The course EE1103 was taken up by me in the first semester while in IITM.
The name of the course is Numerical Methods and was taught by Prof. Anil Prabhakar.
The content of the course contains various numerical methods required and used by electric enginners through their journey while learning to use C.
My partners through the course were Neham Jain (IITM Roll No: EE19B084) through the first half of the course
and Pranav Phatak (IITM Roll No: EE19B105) through the later.
